  <h1>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Rodion</h1>
  <h3>
    I'm a web developer. My passion is to develop modern and responsive
    websites.
  </h3>
  <p>
    I have a life interest for all things web and developing code. The fact is
    that I get a huge moral satisfaction, when I create or improve something
    with my own hands. And in programming the results of your actions can be
    seen instantly. I like it a lot.
